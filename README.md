<h1> 👋 Hi, I’m @GoodGabriel and I'm a software developer</h1> 

- 👨‍💻 My real name is Gabriel Tavilla and currently I'm living in Genoa, Italy, EU.

- 😎 Lately I founded a company named Bixait S.r.l and I'm part of the it's company board. 

- 📚 I studied Computer Science for one an a half year at the University Of Genoa but one year ago (yes during the first pandemic explosion) I quitted it.
  Since then I studied by myself and worked as software developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the world and learning something new every day.

- 🙈 As you can see I'm not so good in english but this will not stop me on posting this 😉
