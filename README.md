<h1> 👋 Hi, I’m @GoodGabriel </h1> 
And I'm part of the  <a href="https://bixait.it"> <img src="https://bixait.it/assets/icons/b0-mini.png"></a> project with three other friends. I'm a software developer and technical head of it with another guy.
<br>

- 👨‍💻 My real name is Gabriel Tavilla and currently I'm living in Genoa, Italy, EU.

- 📚 I studied Computer Science for one an a half year at the University Of Genoa but one year ago (yes during the first pandemic explosion) I quitted it.
Since then I studied by myself and worked as software developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the world and learning something new every day.

- 🙈 As you can see I'm not so good in english but this will not stop me on posting this 😉
